Css block layout

The different types of CSS Selectors are:

Simple Selectors
Class Selector
ID Selector
Type (tag name) Selector
Attribute Selector
Universal Selector
Pseudo-class
Compound Selectors
Complex Selectors and many more.

The CSS ID selector selects an HTML element based on its ID attribute value. It consists of a hash (#), followed by the ID of the HTML element.


There should be only one HTML element with a given ID in the entire HTML document. The HTML id attribute value doesn't need to have the prefix section as CCBP UI Kit is not used.

There can be more than one HTML element with the same class name in the HTML document.
