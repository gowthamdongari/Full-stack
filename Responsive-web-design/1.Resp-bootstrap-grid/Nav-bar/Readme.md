In general, HTML elements can be divided into two categories.

Block-level Elements
Inline Elements

These elements always start in a new line and take up the full width available. So, an HTML Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element.

For example, the HTML h1 element, p element, div element, etc.

These elements do not start in a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

For example, the HTML button element, img element, a element, etc.
